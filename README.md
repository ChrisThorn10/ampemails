Code for AMP Emails

This is a new repo used to host AMP4Email code samples and experiments.  Files can be pasted into the amp playground at [amp.gmail.dev] to test functionality

## note
I am still in the process of understanding how AMP works in email.  For many of the files here I have gotten them to validate and work in the playground enviroment, but for some I have not gotten them to work when I send a test version.  Still trying to understand why this is the case.

## files
- form-example-001 is a folder containing assets used to test a multi question form in email
