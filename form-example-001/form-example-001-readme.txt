This form uses field sets to hide and show sets of questions.  Upon successful submission, the form will redirect to a website.  Upon generation of an error a message will be displayed containing further instructions.

To generate an error, select 'Select this Option to Generate an Error' on the second question in the form.  Any other option selected will succesfully redirect you to another page.

Note: originally this email had a form with 3 questions, however I was having issues with including 2 sliders in one form.  Going to do some debugging and testing to see if its an actual issue or user error.


Validator Issues (amp.gmail.dev)
- If you select a valid loan reason and then hit submit on the form, you will receive a success message, however you will not send you to the url. I believe this is because the iframe doesn't har allow-top-navigation flag so no redirecting is allowed

- Testing the error message does work in the validator.

Test Email Sent from Validator
-From the validator, if you send yourself a test email, the error message, nor the url redirect will work. Not sure if these are security features for email or if I am doing something incorrectly. I am currently researching this.
